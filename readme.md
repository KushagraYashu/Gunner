# **GUNNER: FPS GAME**

## A VALORANT Range inspired game by [**Kushagra**](https://bitbucket.org/kushagra_003/) using [**Unity 2020.3.9f1**](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.9)

###### GUNNER is an FPS game made on the UNITY Game Engine. It is inspired by VALORANT and implements the Practice Range of the game. The game consists of 6 different weapons and 3 different types of practice options and an Interactive Environment to simulate the movement of the game.
###### Being heavily inspired by VALORANT the game is intended to expand with multiplayer and economy management features. The game is currently computationally inefficient and requires a mid to high end device to run properly. Being in early stage development the game requires much work but it is a good start for entering into the field of Game development.
